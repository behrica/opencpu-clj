../data/|yes,via "package"|	List data objects in a package.
../{R or data}/{object}|yes|	Read object in default format. If object is a function, it can be called using HTTP POST.
../{R or data}/{object}/{format}|yes|	Retrieve an R object in a particular output format (see section on output formats).

##The R session API
endpoint | supported | description
----------|-----------|------------
/ocpu/tmp/{key}/	|yes| List available output for this session.
/ocpu/tmp/{key}/R	|yes|R objects stored in this session. Interface using R object API, same as objects in packages.
/ocpu/tmp/{key}/graphics/	|yes| Graphics (plots) stored in this session.
/ocpu/tmp/{key}/graphics/{n}/{format}|yes|	Retrieve plot number {n} in output format {format}. Format is usually one of png, pdf or svg. The {n} is an integer or "last".
